# Connect Hosted Payment Page

## Introduction

The easiest way to add payment capabilities to your website is to implement a HTML form that you can use to enable your customers to make a payment.

This type of integration allows you to let our Gateway manage the customer redirections that are required in the checkout process of many payment methods or authentication mechanisms and gives you the option to use secure hosted pages which can reduce the burden of compliance with the Data Security Standard of the Payment Card Industry (PCI DSS).

For steps where no direct consumer interaction is required and no sensitive cardholder data is getting processed, it's best to use our Application Programming Interface (API).

> ### PCI DSS
>
> Please note that if you plan to collect your customer's card details within your environment and send it to our API, you must ensure that your system components are PCI DSS compliant.
