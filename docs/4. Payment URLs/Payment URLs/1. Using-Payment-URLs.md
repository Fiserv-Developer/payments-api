# Payment-URLs

## Using Payment URLs

You can use the /payment-url API to generate a URL that you can send to a customer, which they can then use to pay you. This is useful when sending a customer an invoice - you are more likely to get paid sooner than if provide your bank details and ask for a transfer. When the customer clicks on the payment URL, they are directed to our hosted payment page solution to make a payment, and the payment is routed to your store on our systems for processing. 

Using this API you can Create, Delete and interrogate the status of an existing payment URL.
