# Other Payment URL functions

To delete a Payment URL, add your `storeId` and the `transactionId` from the Payment URL creation request response (`ipgTransactionId`) to the /payment-url header, and use the DELETE method to call the /payment-url API.

You can retrieve the data associated with a payment URL by sending a GET to /paymentURL. Add `storeId` and the `transactionId` from the Payment URL creation request response (`ipgTransactionId`) to the /payment-url header to retrieve the details for a specific Payment URL, or set `storeId`, `fromDate` and `toDate` to call a response with all Payment URLs and their details created within a specific time range.
