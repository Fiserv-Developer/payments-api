# How to request access

In order to integrate with Payment.js, some details need to be registered on our end. 

The Payment.js `apiKey` and `apiSecret` can be retrieved by registering an API application on our [Developer Platform](https://developer.firstdata.eu/)

Once you've generated a sandbox or production key you can request access to Payment.js [here](https://docs.firstdata.com/req/paymentjs).


# Webhooks

> ### Read me!
> Payment.js requires that you provide a webhook. This must be available over HTTPS. It is recommended that you provision a static URL.

The gateway response to the tokenization request is parsed for details, normalized, and then HTTPS POSTed to the configured webhook URL which you provided when you requested accesss to the service.

A webhook url must support HTTPS and include fully qualified domain name as well as route.

A webhook url must only contain static elements.

## Webhook Payload

Below is the payload sent to your webhook.

### Noteworthy headers:

```json json_schema
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "Client-Token": {
      "type": "string",
      "description":"Access/session id for which webhook call applies"
    },
     "Nonce": {
      "type": "string",
      "description":"Should match 'Nonce' header passed in authorize session request"
    },
  }
}
```

### Successful Payload

The schema [available here](https://docs.fiserv.com/docs/payments/branches/2.0.1/reference/PaymnetJs.v1.yaml/components/schemas/WebhookPayload)

```json
{
  "authCode": "ABCABC",
  "card": {
    "bin": "424242",
    "brand": "visa",
    "exp": {
      "month": "02",
      "year": "2022"
    },
    "last4": "4242",
    "name": "Blah Blah",
    "token": "123123123123",
    "masked": "XXXXXXXXXXXX4242",
    "address1": "Apartment 123",
    "address2": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "region": "NY",
    "country": "US",
    "postalCode": "11375",
    "company": "My Company"
  },
  "gatewayRefId": "123123123123",
  "error": false,
  "zeroDollarAuth": {
    "cvv2": "MATCHED",
    "avs": "Y"
  }
}
```

> ### Note
> - `authCode` defaults to ""
> - `gatewayRefId` defaults to ""
> - `zeroDollarAuth` set to false if `zeroDollarAuth` not requested in authorize session
> - `avs` may not be set if address data not present or not returned by gateway
> - `avs` may have different value types for different gateways; IPG returns an object
> - See gateway documentation on what values are expected in the `avs` field


### Error Payload

The schema is [available here](https://docs.fiserv.com/docs/payments/branches/2.0.1/reference/PaymnetJs.v1.yaml/components/schemas/WebhookErrorPayload)

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "reason": "{{ERROR_CODE}}",
  "gatewayRefId": "...",
  "gatewayReason": "...",
  "zeroDollarAuth": {
    "cvv2": "NOT_MATCHED",
    "avs": "N"
  }
}
```
 
 > ### Note
 >
> - `gatewayRefId` defaults to ""
> - `gatewayReason` only added if available and may be a string or json object
> - `zeroDollarAuth` set to false if zeroDollarAuth not requested in authorize session
> - Gateway rejections are treated as errors with reason "REJECTED"
> - `avs` may not be set if address data not present or not returned by gateway
> - `avs` may have different value types for different gateways; IPG returns an object
