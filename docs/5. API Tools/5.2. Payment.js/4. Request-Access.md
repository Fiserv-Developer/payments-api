# Request Access

In order to integrate with Payment.js, some details need to be registered on our end. 

The Payment.js `apiKey` and `apiSecret` can be retrieved by registering an API application on our [Developer Platform](https://developer.firstdata.eu/)

Once you've generated a sandbox or production key you can request access to Payment.js [here](https://docs.firstdata.com/req/paymentjs).
