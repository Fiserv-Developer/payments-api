# Using a reference order to create a payment schedule

To create a payment schedule using a single payment already submitted, submit the payload as per the below to the /payment-schedule API, but include the `referenceOrderId` attribute as the orderId from the response of the original payment. This is useful when a customer buys something as a single purchase, but then elects to continue their access as a subscription to your product or service.
