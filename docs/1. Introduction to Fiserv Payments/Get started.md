# How to get started

## 1. Sign up on our Developer Platform

Head over to [Fiserv Developer](https://developer.firstdata.eu/) and create an account. 

> ### Instant Access
>
> You won't need to apply for an account and you'll have instant access to our sanbox APIs. If you'd like something more then get in contact with us via the contact form and we will get in touch! 

## 2. Generate an API key

Go to the `Apps` page and create a Sandbox app. 

Once you're on the `Apps` page copy your `API key` and `Secret Key`. 

For most of our APIs you can just put the `API Key` into the header under the `API-Key` parameter. However, when you use our Payment APIs you'll need to add them to a `Message-Signature` you an find out more about that in the next page.
