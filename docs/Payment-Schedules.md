# Payment Schedules

## /payment-schedule

The payment schedules API allows you to create and manage a recurring payment schedule for an individual consumer. This API covers creation, update, cancellation and reporting capabilities. As an example, you'd use this API to setup monthly subscription payments against a payment method if you are providing ongoing products or services to a customer. 

The payment schedules API uses the same header and most of the same objects as the /payments API, so if you've already implemented for that API, this should be easy to extend to.
