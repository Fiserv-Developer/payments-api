### Polymorphism

Our Payments API is Polymorphic - this means that you can submit various request types with different payloads to the same API and generate different payments types and responses. The term is taken from chemistry - Polymorphism is the ability of solid materials to exist in two or more crystalline forms with different arrangements. When we apply this to API design, it means the same API can be used for multiple payment actions. We enable this by defining different schemas for the payload body, each of which is used for a different payment action. 

Polymorphism for our Payments API is based on request types (the requestType field), which enables you to distinguish between customer payments based on the type of transaction (sale, refund, cancellation etc.) and the payment method the customer wants to use (credit or debit cart, digital wallet, SEPA, Paypal etc.). You'll use the same end point to execute a payment for all of these variations, but the requestType value you submit, and the other objects in the payload, will vary dependent on the type of customer payment you are trying to take.

As an example, you'll use the paymentCardSaleTransaction requestType to take a normal card payment when a customer wants to check out. You can then use a secondary transaction requestType to refund or void the transaction.
