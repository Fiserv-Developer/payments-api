# Payment-Tokens

## /payment-tokens

Payment tokens allow you to store customer payment cards within your systems without having to store card data, which creates security and compliance requirements such as PCI. You can either submit a request to tokenise a payment card as part of a payment, or you can tokenise the card separately. Tokenising a payment card as part of a payment is covered as part of the /payments guide documentation in the Payments section. \


You can find the /payment-tokens API [here](https://docs.fiserv.com/docs/payments/reference/Payments.v1.yaml/paths/~1payment-tokens/post).

### Create a Payment Token

To tokenise a payment card separately to a payment, POST the payload below to /payment-tokens (example provided for card, but use the relevant paymentMethod object for the instrument of your choice). 

```json 
{
  "requestType": "PaymentCardPaymentTokenizationRequest",
  "paymentCard": {
    "number": "4012000033330026",
    "expiryDate": {
      "month": "12",
      "year": "24"
    }
  },
  "createToken": {
    "value": "123abc456def"
    "reusable": true,
    "declineDuplicates": false
  },
  "accountVerification": false,
  "additionalDetails": {
    "operatorId": "OPERATOR_ID_123XXX",
    "salesSystemId": "W-EU-H3866-FLS2"
  }
}
```

If you want to set your own value for the token, include the `value` attribute in the createToken object. If you don't include this, we'll define the token value and return it in the response as `value` attribute in the paymentToken object. The `reuseable` attribute is boolean. If set to true, the token can be reused. If false, it has only a single use. The `declineDuplicates` attribute is also boolean. If you've provided your own token value for payment instrument, and a payment is submitted with the same payment card, but untokenised, the system will decline the payment (this is a fraud control you can set at token level).

Use the following sample generator to see payloads and responses:

```json

  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Client-Request-Id": "",
    "Api-Key": "",
    "Timestamp": "",
    "Message-Signature": ""
  }
  "body" {
    "requestType": "PaymentCardPaymentTokenizationRequest",
    "paymentCard": {
      "number": "4012000033330026",
      "expiryDate": {
        "month": "12",
        "year": "24"
      }
    },
    "createToken": {
      "value": "123abc456def"
      "reusable": true,
      "declineDuplicates": false
    },
    "accountVerification": false,
    "additionalDetails": {
      "operatorId": "OPERATOR_ID_123XXX",
