# Updating a Payment Schedule

To update a payment schedule, use PATCH to make a call to /payment-schedules/{order-id} where the {order-id} value is the `orderId` value from the response of the original `PaymentSchedulesRequest` POST. Use the same payload structure as for setting up the payment schedule, but identify the payment schedule for update via specifying the `orderId` in the response from the original `PaymentSchedulesRequest` in /payment-schedules/{order-id}. Make updates to the Payment Schedule, Payment Method or Transaction Amount as necessary in the PATCH call payload.

## Cancelling a Payment Schedule

Cancel a Payment Schedule by making a DELETE call to /payment-schedules/{order-id} where the {order-id} value is the `orderId` value from the response of the original `PaymentSchedulesRequest` POST.

## Retrieving Payment Schedule data

Retrieve Payment Schedule data by making a GET call to /payment-schedules/{order-id} where the {order-id} value is the `orderId` value from the response of the original `PaymentSchedulesRequest` POST.
