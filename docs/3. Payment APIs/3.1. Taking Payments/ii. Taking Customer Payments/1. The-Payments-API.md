# /payments

The /payments API allows you to create, inquire about, and finalize payment transactions. It will also enable you to void a previous transaction, to refund a previous transaction or to execute partial refunds or voids. Finally, and where necessary, it will enable you to pre-authorise transactions that can be completed later.

The API enables you to make payments using different payment instruments, via credit or debit cards, tokens or through local payments methods such as SEPA DD or Paypal account. All of these methods are explained below. You can also use the API to accept wallet transactions via payment methods such as Apple Pay or Google Pay. It will allow you to use extra authentication protocols to ensure customer payments are safer, and to protect you from Fraud.

Our Payments API has two main uses - Primary and Secondary Transactions. Primary transactions are typical sale transactions, pre-authorisations or credits. Secondary Transactions let you refund a transaction, void a transaction or complete a pre-authorisation. 

## Primary Transactions

Primary transactions are used to execute a customer payment, pre-authorisation or credit transaction without reference to a prior transaction. For this walkthrough, weâ€™re going to use the PaymentCardSaleTransaction request type (all request types should have links), which you can use for a normal credit or debit card payment transaction without reference to a previous transaction. Each of the different request types, the scenarios in which you might want to use them, and the differences in the JSON for each request type, are explained within this guide.

> MODEL: You can find the model definition for the /payments resource [here](https://docs.fiserv.com/docs/payments/reference/Payments.v1.yaml/paths/~1payments/post).

The PaymentCardSaleTransaction request type requires the following fields to post a Primary Transaction. 

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://prod.api.firstdata.com/ipp/payments-gateway/v2/payments",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Client-Request-Id": "",
    "Api-Key": "",
    "Timestamp": "",
    "Message-Signature": ""
  },
  "body": {
    "requestType": "PaymentCardSaleTransaction",
    "transactionAmount": {
      "total": "12.04",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "paymentMethod": {
      "paymentCard": {
        "number": "5424180279791732",
        "securityCode": "977",
        "expiryDate": {
          "month": "12",
          "year": "24"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Within the /payments model, the most important objects are the `transactionAmount` and the `paymentMethod`. Without these objects, we can't process the payment. We also recommend you include billing information and shipping information as this allows the 3DSecure fingerprint check to run in the background (see the [Implementing-3DSecure](docs/Implementing-3DSecure.md) page for more information), making the checkout process frictionless for your customer and allows our Fraud systems to protect you more easily. Both the `billing` and `shipping` objects follow the same structure:

```json YAML
{
  "name": "Alec Leamas",
  "customerId": "1234567890",
  "contact": {
    "phone": "07777777777",
    "email": "alecleamas@tswciftc.com"
  }
  "address": {
    "address1": "Bernauer Strasse 111",
    "city": "Berlin",
    "postalCode": "13355",
    "country": "Germany"
  }
}
```

The flow below shows a standard payments process using a card payment transaction.
