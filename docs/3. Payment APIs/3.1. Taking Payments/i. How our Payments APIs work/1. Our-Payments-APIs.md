# Payments API

## Use this API to accept Payments of all types, and to process secondary actions like Voids, Refunds or Pre-Auth Completions

You can use our payment API to offer a range of payment methods to your customers. It allows you to take payment using whatever the most appropriate transaction type is. 

Fiserv’s Payment API supports the following major payment methods; Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Sepa, as well as multiple other international and local payment methods. To gain access to payment methods beyond this main set, please contact your integration services representative.

Our payments end points can be used to create and complete a payment, create and manage a recurring payment schedule, generate a payment link to send to a customer, verify a customer’s card or offer them the option to pay in their local currency. 

You can also use our Store Management APIs to manage your store configuration.

Once you’ve executed a transaction using these APIs, you can retrieve all the detail you need on the transaction using our Merchant Intelligence APIs.
