# Header and Parameters

Our Payments API have a consistent Header structure based on a set of Parameters. To create the header, provide the following values:

Header Parameter | Type | Description
-----------------|------|------------
 Content-Type | String | Define this attribute as application/json
 Client-Request-Id | String | This is an ID you generate so we can mutually track your requests. It should be unique per request. We recommend this is built in 128-bit UUID format. 
 Api-Key | String | This is the key you'll use to identify yourself to us. You'll be given a key for development and testing, then a different key when you're ready to go live. 
 Timestamp | Integer | You should define this as an epoch timestamp in milliseconds. This is used for message signature generation and for time limit control.
 Message-Signature | String | We use this for security. The Message-Signature is the Base64 encoded HMAC hash (SHA256 algorithm with the API Secret as the key.) For more information, refer to the supporting documentation on the Developer Portal.

The header is constructed as per the following example.

```json YAML
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://prod.emea.api.fiservapps.com/ipp/payments-gateway/v2/payments",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Client-Request-Id": "",
    "Api-Key": "",
    "Timestamp": "",
    "Message-Signature": ""
  },
}
```
