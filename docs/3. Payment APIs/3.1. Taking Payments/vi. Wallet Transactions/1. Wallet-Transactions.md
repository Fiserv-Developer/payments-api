# Implementing Wallet Payment Methods

This section provides a step-by-step for implementing Apple Pay and Google Pay.

Apple Pay and Google Pay are Wallet transactions. This means the transaction originates from a digital wallet held either on a device (Apple/ios or Google/Android).

To implement either wallet payment method, please follow the steps under the relevant section. The step by step guides tell you how to integrate our payments APIs to the Apple Pay and Google Pay services available within those ecosystems.
